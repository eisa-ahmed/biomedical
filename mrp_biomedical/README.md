# MrpBioMedical Module

This repository holds the MrpBioMedical module, which provides advanced manufacturing process management for Odoo's Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) system, tailored for the biomedical industry. The module enhances efficiency and traceability in manufacturing operations.

## List of Features:

1. **Custom Bill of Materials (BoM) Templates:** Define customized bills of materials with predefined templates for each work process in the manufacturing operation. This ensures standardized and accurate information capture for every process step.

2. **Process Dependency Management:** Link different processes together to set up dependencies, ensuring that a work process cannot start until its dependencies are completed. This feature maintains the logical flow and sequence of operations.

3. **Work Order Signatures:** Enable users to sign off on work orders upon their completion. This adds a layer of accountability and verification for each finished operation.

4. **Operation Time Tracking:** Capture the start and end times of each work process along with the personnel responsible. This feature helps in tracking the time spent on each operation, facilitating better time management and productivity analysis.

5. **Advanced Filtering and Order Tracking:** Utilize advanced filtering options to keep track of past orders, providing detailed insights and historical data for continuous improvement and audit purposes.


## Configuration

1. **Creating BoM Templates:** Navigate to the Manufacturing configuration panel, and use the 'BoM Templates' menu to add or modify templates for each work process. These templates standardize data entry and ensure completeness of information.

2. **Setting Up Process Dependencies:** Under the same 'BoM Templates' menu, define dependencies between processes to control the workflow. The system enforces these dependencies, preventing the start of processes until prerequisite steps are completed.

3. **Work Order Sign-Off:** Users can sign off on completed work orders, adding their signature through the work order interface. This can be configured and monitored from the 'Work Orders' menu.

4. **Tracking Operation Times:** The module automatically records the start and end times of each operation along with the responsible personnel. These details are available in the 'Operation Logs' section for review and analysis.

5. **Order Tracking and Filtering:** Use the advanced filtering options in the 'Orders' menu to view and manage past orders. This feature provides robust tracking capabilities and helps in maintaining an organized record of manufacturing operations.

6. **Scheduled Resets and Automation:** The module includes scheduled actions to automate various tasks such as resetting operation stats or updating dependencies, ensuring smooth and efficient manufacturing processes without manual intervention.
